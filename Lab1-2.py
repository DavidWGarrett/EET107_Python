print('''The people will live on.
The learning and blundering people will live on.
They will be tricked and sold and again sold
And go back to the nourishing earth for rootholds,
The people so peculiar in renewal and comeback,
You can\'t laugh off their capacity to take it.
The mammoth rests between his cyclonic dramas.
David Garrett''')
