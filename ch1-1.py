print('Python was released in 1991')
# Changed 'Print' to 'print'. An uppercase P in the print() function causes an error. Python language is case-sensitive.
# Added an ' after 1991. This allows the print function to read "Python was released in 1991" as a string
print("It was created by \"Guido van Rossum\"")
# Added two escape character infront of the quotation marks surrounding "Guido van Rossum"
# The escape characters allow the print function to view the quotation marks as a part of the string
